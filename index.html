                <span class="bottom-text">Star Wars is an American epic space opera multimedia franchise created by
                    George Lucas, which began with the eponymous 1977 film[b] and quickly became a worldwide pop culture
                    phenomenon. The franchise has been expanded into various films and other media, including television
                    series, video games, novels, comic books, theme park attractions, and themed areas, comprising an
                    all-encompassing fictional universe. Star Wars is one of the highest-grossing media franchises of
                    all time.
                    <br><br>
                    The original film (Star Wars), retroactively subtitled Episode IV: A New Hope (1977), was followed
                    by the sequels Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983),
                    forming the original Star Wars trilogy. Lucas later returned to the series to direct a prequel
                    trilogy, consisting of Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999), Episode II: Attack of the Clones
                    (2002), and Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005). In 2012, Lucas sold his production company to
                    Disney, relinquishing his ownership of the franchise. This led to a sequel trilogy, consisting of
                    Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015), Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017), and Episode IX: The Rise
                    of Skywalker (2019).
                    <br><br>
                    All nine films of the "Skywalker Saga" were nominated for Academy Awards, with wins going to the
                    first two releases. Together with the theatrical live action "anthology" films Rogue One (2016) and
                    Solo (2018), the combined box office revenue of the films equated to over US$10 billion, which makes
                    it the second-highest-grossing film franchise of all time.</span>
